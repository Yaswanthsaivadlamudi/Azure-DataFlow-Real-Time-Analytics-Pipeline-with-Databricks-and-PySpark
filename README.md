# Azure DataFlow: Real-Time Analytics Pipeline with Databricks and PySpark

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a real-time, parameterized, end-to-end data pipeline using **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks**, **PySpark**, and other modern data engineering tools. The pipeline processes Netflix's public dataset and implements the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)** for efficient data ingestion, transformation, and analytics.

The solution is designed to handle incremental data ingestion, dynamic parameterization, and real-time analytics while integrating seamlessly with visualization tools like **Power BI**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic ETL Pipelines:** Parameterized workflows using Azure Data Factory for real-time data validation.
- **Incremental Data Ingestion:** Implemented with Databricks Autoloader to handle streaming and batch data.
- **Medallion Architecture:**
  - **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion.
  - **Silver Layer:** Cleaned and transformed datasets.
  - **Gold Layer:** Aggregated datasets for business intelligence.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Delta Live Tables for efficient ETL workflows.
- **Visualization Integration:** Power BI dashboards for reporting and insights.

## 🔄 Pipeline Workflow

### 📥 Data Ingestion
- Source data is ingested from GitHub into **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)** using Azure Data Factory.
- Incremental loading is handled by **Databricks Autoloader**.

### 🧹 Data Transformation
- **PySpark scripts** in Databricks clean and transform the raw data into **Delta Live Tables**.
- Medallion architecture is applied to process the data through **Bronze → Silver → Gold** layers.

### 📊 Data Analytics & Visualization
- The **Gold layer** aggregates are used to create **Power BI dashboards** for real-time insights.
