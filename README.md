Azure DataFlow: Real-Time Analytics Pipeline with Databricks and PySpark
Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a real-time, parameterized, end-to-end data pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, PySpark, and other modern data engineering tools. The pipeline processes Netflix's public dataset and implements the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) for efficient data ingestion, transformation, and analytics.
The solution is designed to handle incremental data ingestion, dynamic parameterization, and real-time analytics while integrating seamlessly with visualization tools like Power BI.
Features
Dynamic ETL Pipelines: Parameterized workflows using Azure Data Factory for real-time data validation.
Incremental Data Ingestion: Implemented with Databricks Autoloader to handle streaming and batch data.
Medallion Architecture:
Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion.
Silver Layer: Cleaned and transformed datasets.
Gold Layer: Aggregated datasets for business intelligence.
Real-Time Analytics: Delta Live Tables for efficient ETL workflows.
Visualization Integration: Power BI dashboards for reporting and insights.
Architecture: Medallion Architecture
Bronze Layer: Raw data storage (unprocessed).
Silver Layer: Cleaned and enriched data.
Gold Layer: Business-ready aggregated datasets.

Dataset
The project uses Netflix's public dataset available on GitHub. The dataset includes information about movies, TV shows, genres, release years, etc.
Pipeline Workflow
Data Ingestion
Source data is ingested from GitHub into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) using Azure Data Factory.
Incremental loading is handled by Databricks Autoloader.
Data Transformation
PySpark scripts in Databricks clean and transform the raw data into Delta Live Tables.
Medallion architecture is applied to process the data through Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
Data Analytics & Visualization
The Gold layer aggregates are used to create Power BI dashboards for real-time insights.
